# The-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Birds


## Description
Climate is changing around the world. This change is impacting species of wild animals. In this project, we used four decades of bird sightings and climate data to predict the distribution of a bird species in the Scottish Highlands and see how its distribution changed over the years.  We used data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and a subset of the UKCP09 climate data from the UK Met Office.
